abstract  ="The modelling of materials properties and processes from first principles is becoming sufficiently accurate as to facilitate the design and testing of new systems in silico. Computational materials science is both valuable and increasingly necessary for developing novel functional materials and composites that meet the requirements of next-generation technology. A range of simulation techniques are being developed and applied to problems related to materials for energy generation{,} storage and conversion including solar cells{,} nuclear reactors{,} batteries{,} fuel cells{,} and catalytic systems. Such techniques may combine crystal-structure prediction (global optimisation){,} data mining (materials informatics) and high-throughput screening with elements of machine learning. We explore the development process associated with computational materials design{,} from setting the requirements and descriptors to the development and testing of new materials. As a case study{,} we critically review progress in the fields of thermoelectrics and photovoltaics{,} including the simulation of lattice thermal conductivity and the search for Pb-free hybrid halide perovskites. Finally{,} a number of universal chemical-design principles are advanced."}

Although the main materials currently used or investigated and the associated fabrication technologies are individually described, emphasis is on silicon-based solar cells. Wafer-based crystalline silicon solar modules dominate in terms of production, but amorphous silicon solar cells have the potential to undercut costs owing, for example, to the roll-to-roll production possibilities for modules. Recent developments suggest that thin-film crystalline silicon (especially microcrystalline silicon) is becoming a prime candidate for future photovoltaics.},

abstract  ="The need for large scale low carbon solar electricity production has become increasingly urgent for reasons of energy security and climate change mitigation. Third-generation solar cells (SCs) are solution processed SCs based on semiconducting organic macromolecules{,} inorganic nanoparticles or hybrids. This review considers and compares three types of promising 3rd-generation SCs: polymer:fullerene{,} hybrid polymer and perovskite SCs. The review considers work reported since an earlier review (Saunders et al.{,} Adv. Colloid Interface Sci.{,} 2008{,} 138{,} 1) and highlights the great progress that has been made in each area. We consider the operation principles for each SC type and also review the state-of-the-art devices. The polymer:fullerene and hybrid polymer SC open circuit voltages are compared to values predicted from the well-known Scharber equation and similarities and differences discussed. The perovskite SCs are also considered and their remarkable rate of power conversion efficiency performance increase is discussed. The review considers the requirements for large-scale deployment in the contexts of semiconducting polymer and hole transport matrix synthesis and materials selection. It is concluded that the 3rd-generation SC technologies discussed here are well placed for major contribution to large scale energy production. (This has already been partially demonstrated for polymer:fullerene SCs.) Looking further ahead we propose that several of the 3rd-generation SCs considered here have excellent potential to provide the low cost large-scale deployment needed to meet the terawatt challenge for solar electricity generation."}

abstract = "To ensure photovoltaics become a major sustainable player in a competitive power-generation market, they must provide abundant, affordable electricity, with environmental impacts drastically lower than those from conventional power generation. The recent reduction in the cost of 2nd generation thin-film \{PV\} is remarkable, meeting the production milestone of $1 per watt in the fourth quarter of 2008. This achievement holds great promise for the future. However, the questions remaining are whether the expense of \{PV\} modules can be lowered further, and if there are resource- and environmental-impact constraints to growth. I examine the potential of thin-films in a prospective life-cycle analysis, focusing on direct costs, resource availability, and environmental impacts. These three aspects are closely related; developing thinner solar cells and recycling spent modules will become increasingly important in resolving cost, resource, and environmental constraints to large scales of sustainable growth.

The density-of-states, the complex dielectric function ε(ω)&#xa0;=&#xa0;ε1(ω)&#xa0;+&#xa0;iε2(ω), and the optical absorption coefficient α(ω) are determined, providing fundamental understanding of these materials. We find that even though the \{PBE\} method generates fairly accurate effective crystal potentials, the \{HSE\} and \{GW\} methods improve considerably the band-gap energies Eg and also the localization of the semicore states, thereby describing the optical properties much better. Furthermore, we also present optimized convergence parameters for the self-consistent \{HSE\} calculation in order to reduce the computational time of this orbital-dependent method. "

The Cu/(Zn+Sn) ratio of the thin film sputtered at 75&#xa0;W was close to the stoichiometry of Cu2ZnSnS4. However, the S/(Cu+Zn+Sn) ratio was less than the stoichiometry. The as-deposited films were amorphous and annealed in the atmosphere of Ar+S2 (g). The annealed (1&#xa0;1&#xa0;2), (2&#xa0;0&#xa0;0), (2&#xa0;2&#xa0;0), (3&#xa0;1&#xa0;2) planes were conformed to all the reflection of a kesterite structure. A preferred (1&#xa0;1&#xa0;2) orientation was observed with the increase of the annealing temperature. The optical absorption coefficient of the thin film was about 1.0×104&#xa0;cm−1. The optical band energy was derived to be 1.51&#xa0;eV. The optical absorption coefficient of the sputtered Cu2ZnSnS4 thin films was less than that of CuInS2 thin film, however, the band gap energy was more appropriate for photovoltaic materials. "

Kramers-Kronig and least-squares fitting analyses are used to determine the values of the phonon frequencies and dielectric constants for light polarized parallel to the a, b and c crystal axes. Transmission measurements on thin samples are also reported which confirm the reflectivity measurements.}

  abstract={Non-radiative transitions affect many aspects of semiconductor performance. Normally they reduce device efficiency by suppressing luminescence, creating defects, reducing carrier lifetimes, or enhancing diffusion during operation. The present review surveys both the theoretical and practical understanding of non-radiative transitions. It includes general theoretical results and the associated ideas, with the emphasis on phonon-induced and defect Auger processes. Most of the purely formal aspects are omitted, but the points of principle where uncertainties remain are discussed. The review also covers the relation between basic theoretical studies and practical applied work on device degradation. This includes a description of the atomic processes involved in the more important mechanism of device deterioration and the theoretical understanding of the mechanism of these underlying processes. Finally, there is a survey of models proposed for 'killer' centres.}

Both compounds were found to crystallize in the kesterite type structure, but with a disorder within the Cu–Zn layers at z=1/4 and 3/4. The latter causes CuZn and ZnCu anti-site defects, whose concentration depends on the sample growth conditions. The temperature dependent structural phase transition in \{CZTS\} was studied by in-situ high temperature diffraction experiments using high energy synchrotron X-rays. The transition from the tetragonal kesterite to the cubic sphalerite type structure is discussed by means of the interplay of increasing and decreasing cation–anion–cation bond angles in the coordination tetrahedra, reflected by the shift of the anion atomic coordinates to more ideal (x and y) or non-ideal (z) values. This striking behavior may be connected with frustrations that occur due to the triangular geometry of the coordination tetrahedra. "

Devices prepared with similar metal compositions show different open-circuit voltages and fill factors. These metrics are correlated with the concentration of QDAPs in the absorbers. One additional device with insufficient zinc showed the empirically observed low-efficiency expected for this composition.

abstract = {The growth of $Cu_2ZnSnS_4$ (CZTS) polycrystals from solid state reaction over a range of compositions, including the regions which produce the highest efficiency photovoltaic devices, is reported. X-ray measurements confirm the growth of crystalline CZTS. Temperature and intensity dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements show an increase in the energy of the main CZTS luminescence peak with both increasing laser power and increasing temperature. Analysis of the PL peak positions and intensity behavior demonstrates that the results are consistent with the model of fluctuating potentials. This confirms that the polycrystals are heavily doped with the presence of a large concentration of intrinsic defects. The behavior of the main luminescence feature is shown to be qualitatively similar over a broad range of compositions although the nature and amount of secondary phases vary significantly. The implications for thin-film photovoltaic devices are discussed},

@article{Hones,
abstract = {$Cu_2ZnSnS_4$ is a promising candidate for thin film solar cells with absorbers made of non-toxic and abundant elements. So far very little effort has been put into understanding the basic material properties. We investigate vapour phase grown Cu2SnZnS4 crystals by temperature and intensity dependent photoluminescence measurements. We observe for the first time narrow photoluminescence peaks, which allow us to determine defect levels and to propose a defect recombination model for Cu2SnZnS4. Assuming an exciton binding energy of 10 meV, we find an energy gap of 1.519 eV at 10 K. From the observed DA transitions we derive the energies of two shallow acceptor states 10±5 and 30±5 meV above the valence band and one shallow donor state 5±3 meV below the conduction band. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Best solar efficiencies are found in a very narrow Cu-poor, Zn-rich composition range. Photoluminescence measurements performed at 12 K indicate strong compensation for Cu-poor composition, similar to what is observed in chalcopyrite-type compounds. We find that strongly copper-deficient CZTS contains significant amounts of ZnS, which degrades the solar cell performance. },

abstract = {Kesterite materials $Cu_2ZnSn(S,Se)_4$ are made from non-toxic, earth-abundant and low-cost raw materials. We summarise here the structural and electronic material data relevant for the solar cells. The equilibrium structure of both $Cu_2ZnSnS_4$ and Cu2ZnSnSe4 is the kesterite structure. However, the stannite structure has only a slightly lower binding energy. Because the band gap of the stannite is predicted to be about 100?meV lower than the kesterite band gap, any admixture of stannite will hurt the solar cells. The band gaps of Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 are 1.5 and 1.0?eV, respectively. Hardly any experiments on defects are available. Theoretically, the CuZn antisite acceptor is predicted as the most probable defect. The existence region of the kesterite phase is smaller compared with that of chalcopyrites. This makes secondary phases a serious challenge in the development of solar cells. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Jarv,
abstract = {The performance of organometallic perovskite solar cells has rapidly surpassed that of both conventional dye-sensitized and organic photovoltaics. High-power conversion efficiency can be realized in both mesoporous and thin-film device architectures. We address the origin of this success in the context of the materials chemistry and physics of the bulk perovskite as described by electronic structure calculations. In addition to the basic optoelectronic properties essential for an efficient photovoltaic device (spectrally suitable band gap, high optical absorption, low carrier effective masses), the materials are structurally and compositionally flexible. As we show, hybrid perovskites exhibit spontaneous electric polarization; we also suggest ways in which this can be tuned through judicious choice of the organic cation. The presence of ferroelectric domains will result in internal junctions that may aid separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs, and reduction of recombination through segregation of charge carriers. The combination of high dielectric constant and low effective mass promotes both Wannier-Mott exciton separation and effective ionization of donor and acceptor defects. The photoferroic effect could be exploited in nanostructured films to generate a higher open circuit voltage and may contribute to the current-voltage hysteresis observed in perovskite solar cells.},

The results obtained show that existing models are unable fully to explain the effect. Parallel measurements of the surface photovoltages associated with cleaved single-crystal CdTe lead to a new interpretation in terms of surface photovoltages in small inclined crystallites.}

abstract = {The ferroelectric-photovoltaic (FE-PV) device, in which a homogeneous ferroelectric material is used as a light absorbing layer, has been investigated during the past several decades with numerous ferroelectric oxides. The FE-PV effect is distinctly different from the typical photovoltaic (PV) effect in semiconductor p–n junctions in that the polarization electric field is the driving force for the photocurrent in FE-PV devices. In addition, the anomalous photovoltaic effect, in which the voltage output along the polarization direction can be significantly larger than the bandgap of the ferroelectric materials, has been frequently observed in FE-PV devices. However, a big challenge faced by the FE-PV devices is the very low photocurrent output. The research interest in FE-PV devices has been re-spurred by the recent discovery of above-bandgap photovoltage in materials with ferroelectric domain walls, electric switchable diodes and photovoltaic effects, tip-enhanced photovoltaic effects at the nanoscale, and new low-bandgap ferroelectric materials and device design. In this feature article, we reviewed the advance in understanding the mechanisms of the ferroelectric photovoltaic effects and recent progress in improving the photovoltaic device performance, including the emerging approaches of integrating the ferroelectric materials into organic heterojunction photovoltaic devices for very high efficiency PV devices.},

abstract = {Ferroelectrics carry a switchable spontaneous electric polarization. This polarization is usually coupled to strain, making ferroelectrics good piezoelectrics. When coupled to magnetism, they become so-called multiferroic systems, a field that has been widely investigated since 2003. While ferroelectrics are birefringent and non-linear optically transparent materials, the coupling of polarization with optical properties has received, since 2009, renewed attention, triggered notably by low-bandgap ferroelectrics suitable for sunlight spectrum absorption and original photovoltaic effects. Consequently, power conversion efficiencies up to 8.1{\%} were recently achieved and values of 19.5{\%} were predicted, making photoferroelectrics promising photovoltaic alternatives. This article aims at providing an up-to-date review on this emerging and rapidly progressing field by highlighting several important issues and parameters, such as the role of domain walls, ways to tune the bandgap, consequences arising from the polarization switchability, and the role of defects and contact electrodes, as well as the downscaling effects. Beyond photovoltaicity, other polarization-related processes are also described, like light-induced deformation (photostriction) or light-assisted chemical reaction (photostriction). It is hoped that this overview will encourage further avenues to be explored and challenged and, as a byproduct, will inspire other research communities in material science, e.g., so-called hybrid halide perovskites.},

The materials are semiconductors with direct band gaps at the boundary of the first Brillouin zone.

  abstract={This paper reviews the recent developments in first-principles total energy studies of the phenomenological equilibrium 'doping limit rule' that governs the maximum electrical conductivity of semiconductors via extrinsic or intrinsic doping. The rule relates the maximum equilibrium carrier concentrations (electrons or holes) of a wide range of materials to their respective band alignments. The microscopic origin of the mysterious 'doping limit rule' is the spontaneous formation of intrinsic defects: e.g., in n-type semiconductors, the formation of cation vacancies. Recent developments in overcoming the equilibrium doping limits are also discussed: it appears that a common route to significantly increase carrier concentrations is to expand the physically accessible range of the dopant atomic chemical potential by non-equilibrium doping processes, which not only suppresses the formation of the intrinsic defects but also lowers the formation energy of the impurities, thereby significantly increasing their solubility.}

@article{Lany_defects,
abstract = {The theoretical description of defects and impurities in semiconductors is largely based on density functional theory (DFT) employing supercell models. The literature discussion of uncertainties that limit the predictivity of this approach has focused mostly on two issues: (1) finite-size effects, in particular for charged defects; (2) the band-gap problem in local or semi-local DFT approximations. We here describe how finite-size effects (1) in the formation energy of charged defects can be accurately corrected in a simple way, i.e. by potential alignment in conjunction with a scaling of the Madelung-like screened first order correction term. The factor involved with this scaling depends only on the dielectric constant and the shape of the supercell, and quite accurately accounts for the full third order correction according to Makov and Payne. We further discuss in some detail the background and justification for this correction method, and also address the effect of the ionic screening on the magnitude of the image charge energy. In regard to (2) the band-gap problem, we discuss the merits of non-local external potentials that are added to the DFT Hamiltonian and allow for an empirical band-gap correction without significantly increasing the computational demand over that of standard DFT calculations. In combination with LDA + U, these potentials are further instrumental for the prediction of polaronic defects with localized holes in anion-p orbitals, such as the metal-site acceptors in wide-gap oxide semiconductors.},
